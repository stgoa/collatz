# Lean lane — LOG

Newest first. Each entry: iteration, target, outcome, axioms, receipts,
and any insight sent to the feed.

## Iteration 1 — 2026-10-18 late evening

- Branch `claude/lean-lane` cut from main `8572962` (main had merged the
  lane-3 Lean audit as PR #2 at `dda3ee9`). Commit monitor on
  `origin/main` and `origin/claude/sidekick` armed (90 s polling).
- **Target 1 verified.** `PeriodicRigidity.lean` (sha256
  `75607bfe…3d1e`) compiles with `lake env lean` on Lean 4.35.0-rc2 /
  Mathlib `0653561`, no warnings. `#print axioms`:
  `periodic_invariant_const`, `const_of_odd_period`, `succ_eq`,
  `period_div_three`, `control_three_x_plus_five` all
  `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`; `period_odd_part` `[propext]`.
  Proof: period drops to its odd part by doubling; a period `3K` drops to
  `K` by strong induction on `n` with a parity split; for an odd period
  coprime to 3, `h(6x+1) = h(x) = h(6x+2)` through odd representatives and
  the invertibility of 6 give `h(n+1) = h(n)`. Two compile rounds: the
  first failed only on two renamed Mathlib lemmas
  (`Nat.exists_mul_mod_eq_one_of_coprime`, `Nat.Coprime.mul_left`).
- Statement match recorded in STATE.md (Lean hypotheses on all of ℕ imply
  main's positive-integer version).
- Insight duty: main pushed `f54b741`/`4f1704c` (V004, "full
  binary-automatic Collatz invariant rigidity") during this iteration.
  Read in full; mathematics checks out modulo Cobham + finite-kernel
  characterisation. Sent the assessment, a literature pointer
  (Shallit–Wilson 1992) and the Lean plan to the sidekick for its feed.
  Queue re-prioritised: V004-i (odd-eventually-periodic rigidity) is the
  next target; it strictly strengthens target 1.
- Draft PR for the lane: stgoa/collatz#3.
