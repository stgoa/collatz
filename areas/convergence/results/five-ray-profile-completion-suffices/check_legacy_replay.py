"""Replay this node's unmodified legacy checks in a temporary copy of the legacy layout.

Written at the B18-replay-revival migration (on tools/legacy_replay.py). The legacy scripts load
sibling modules and data by their pre-migration paths, so they no longer run in this folder;
tools/legacy_replay.py rebuilds the pre-migration tree in a temporary directory and runs them there,
requiring exit 0 and every file byte-identical afterwards. Nothing in the repository is written.
Run from the repository root: python3 <this file>. Exits 1 on any failure.

What this node replays:
  - reviews/side_lane/r24_check.py: side-lane probe (Claude side lane, 2026-10-17): the ordered cutoffs' ratios and divisibility over 355 cutoffs and the base (every odd seed <= 6144 reaches 1).
